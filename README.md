## Collaboration Guideline – Repair Management System

Organizing the Repository
To keep things structured, we follow a clear system for organizing files. Authentication, task management, and UI components each have their own dedicated space. No messy folders—everything stays neat and easy to navigate.
How We Handle Branching & Contributions
Instead of working directly on main, we create branches for new features and bug fixes (like feature-authentication or fix-pagination). This keeps things clean and prevents accidental changes. When making updates, we always push a separate branch and submit a pull request for review before merging.
Code Reviews & Team Collaboration
No code goes in without a second pair of eyes checking it. Reviews help maintain consistency and catch issues early. We use GitHub Discussions for questions and clarifications instead of flooding the chat with messages.
Tracking Issues & Managing Tasks
Whenever bugs pop up or new features need attention, we document them in the Issues section. Each issue includes details on what's broken or needs improving, and we use labels like enhancement, bug, or documentation to keep things sorted.
Keeping Documentation Updated
A well-maintained README ensures that anyone new to the project can get started easily. Whenever major changes happen, we update the documentation so future contributors aren’t left scratching their heads. And yes, commit messages should always be clear—something like [Fix] Improved pagination for smoother navigation.
